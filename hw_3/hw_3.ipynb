    "## CalCalc\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a module called `CalCalc`, with a method called `calculate` that evaluates any string passed to it, and can be used from either the command line (using `argparse` with reasonable flags) or imported within Python. Feel free to use something like `eval()`, but be aware of some of the nasty things it can do, and make sure it doesn’t have too much power:  http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html. Perhaps explore the use of `numexpr` to constrain the landscape of possible uses to math expressions.\n",
